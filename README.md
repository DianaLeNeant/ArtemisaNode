# Artemisa
by Diana Nu√±o

###### A complete solution for you.

Artemisa was made for enterprises administration, sales, human resources, and in fact, everything else in the sales enterprise management. This version is still in development and in process to become totally flexible and moldable, adaptive to any kind of enterprise out there.

### Main architecture description

Artemisa was build in Node.js, this repository is for the main server.

Also, Artemisa is build in several parts:
  - Main server (this)
  - Mobile apps ... (other repositories)

There are changes to be made soon:

  - express
  - body-parser
  - socket.io

  - crypto
  - html-pdf
  - qrcode-generator
  - get-json
  - money
  - require-reload
  - read-last-lines
  - nodemailer
  - email-exists
  - moment
  - nexmo

There's a situation with html-pdf, and the notes to solve the issues are:
