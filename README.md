by Diana Nu√±o

###### A complete solution for you.

### Main architecture description

Artemisa was build in Node.js, this repository is for the main server.

Also, Artemisa is build in several parts:
  - Main server (this)
  - Mobile apps ... (other repositories)

There are changes to be made soon:
  - Add color schemes to that JSON files of configuration.
  
The above changes will assure systems runtime modifications, at least the most regular ones.

### How to put this on march?

Artemisa can run in a small environment with node. Almost every node module is here yet, but the below list will have all dependencies named:

  - mysql
  - mime-types
  - express
  - body-parser
  - socket.io
  - readline
  - colors
  - multer
  - crypto
  - html-pdf
  - qrcode-generator
  - get-json
  - money
  - require-reload
  - read-last-lines
  - nodemailer
  - email-exists
  - moment
  - nexmo

There's a situation with html-pdf, and the notes to solve the issues are:
  ... lost?
  
No more readme notes for now. Documentation will expand from now.
